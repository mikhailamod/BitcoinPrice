# BitcoinPrice - not the final name
An android app to track cryptocurrency prices and check graphs.

My idea is to create a simple and clean interface using Material Design.

What will it do at release?
1. View the current price of any of your 5 favourite cryptos in US Dollars or local currency.
2. View a graph of the crypto for the last 24 hours, 3, 7, 14, 30 and 60 days. 
3. View a summary of the top 100 coins from CoinMarketCap.

Long Term Goal:
The ability to track your transactions in a manner similar to Blockfolio.

What can it currently do?
1. View the current price of Bitcoin, Ether and OmiseGO in US Dollars or South African Rands.
2. View a graph of the selected cryptocurrency for the last 7, 14, 30 or 60 days.

Features to implement soon:
1. Choose 5 favourite coins
2. Top 100 list
